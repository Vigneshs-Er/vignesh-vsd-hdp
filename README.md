# Week 0 Assignment – Tool Installation (VSD Program)

### This repository documents the installation and verification of essential open-source tools required for hardware design and verification as part of the VSD (VLSI System Design) training program.

# The tools were installed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Linux).

Tools Installed:

Yosys – Open-source framework for RTL synthesis

Icarus Verilog (iverilog) – Verilog simulation and verification tool

GTKWave – Waveform viewer for digital simulation output

# 1. Yosys Installation & Verification

Yosys is used for RTL synthesis of Verilog designs.

✅ Successfully installed and tested.

# 2. Icarus Verilog (iverilog) Installation & Verification

Icarus Verilog is used to compile and simulate Verilog HDL code.

✅ Successfully installed and verified.
## 2.Iverilog installation Check

# 3. GTKWave Installation & Verification

GTKWave is used to view simulation waveforms generated by iverilog.

✅ Successfully installed and verified.
## 3.GTK wave installation check

# 4. AND Gate Simulation using Iverilog + GTKWave

To validate the toolchain, a simple AND gate Verilog design was simulated using iverilog, and the waveform was viewed in GTKWave.

✅ Simulation output successfully observed in GTKWave.
##4.AND gate simulation using GTK WAVE check

# Conclusion

All three tools (Yosys, Iverilog, GTKWave) were successfully installed, verified, and tested on Ubuntu 22.04. The AND gate simulation confirms the environment setup is working as expected.
